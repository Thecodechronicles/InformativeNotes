Append this in '/etc/bluetooth/main.conf' file:
'[General]
 Enable=Source,Sink,Headset,Gateway,Control,Media
 Disable=Socket'
(Inverted commas are to be leftout while copying the text)
(changes appended by Ankit. Remove all the above text(if already present) from the said file to revert to the original)


Append this in '/etc/bluetooth/audio.conf' file:
'# This section contains options which are not specific to any
 # particular interface
 [General]
 Enable=Source,Sink,Headset,Gateway,Control,Media

(Possiblity of Bluez or Bluetooth-Manager using this file is negligent. Therefore existence of this file is, perhaps, inconsequential. Originally, the file didn't exist. This file was created by Ankit)


Append this in '~/.config/pulse/system.pa' file:
'.include /etc/pulse/system.pa
 load-module module-bluetooth-policy
 load-module module-bluetooth-discover'
(This file is not required, Hit and Trial. Therefore, the content can be deleted from the file. This file was created by Ankit under a directory. The directory '~/.config/pulse/' was also created by Ankit by using 'sudo mkdir ~/.config/pulse/' command)


For using sdptool(eg: sudo sdptool search --bdaddr 88:6B:0F:0F:6C:D7 a2src) command, do the following:          
'ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd --compat' (changes in '/etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.bluez.service'. Originally, the text was 'ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd')
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth

Hcitools for changing bluetooth dongle chipset properties:
 
hciconfig hci0 version
(hcitool commands for generic bluetooth chipset information)

sudo bccmd -d hci0 psget bdaddr
(To get the address of bluetooth dongle chipset
Output: 
'Bluetooth address: 0xda00 0x1371 0x7d00 0x1a00'
Previous address '0xda00 0x1371 0x7d00 0x1a00 (00:1A:7D:DA:71:13)' became '0x0000 0x0c47 0x0700 0x0100 (da 00 12 71 7d 00 1a 00)' upon changing to new address)

sudo bccmd -d hci0 psset -s 0 bdaddr da 00 12 71 7d 00 1a 00
sudo bccmd -d hci0 psset -s 1 bdaddr da 00 12 71 7d 00 1a 00
sudo bccmd -d hci0 psset -s 2 bdaddr da 00 12 71 7d 00 1a 00
(All above commands need to be given for changing address of bluetooth dongle chipset(csr4.0) in RAM as well as ROM memory of it;  

Parameters: 
s 0 - for RAM, s 1 and so on - for ROM; 
bdaddr - Blutooth Address; 
hci0 - blutooth dongle chipset 1, hci1- bluetooth dongle chipset 2; 
da 00 12 71 7d 00 1a 00 - new chipset hexadecimal address, Changed Hexadecimal Chipset Adress 'da 00 12 71 7d 00 1a 00' was displayed as '00:01:07:00:47:0C')

bccmd -d hci0 warmreset
(for making changes permanent in the bluetooth dongle otherwise changed address will be lost after reboot)

(bdaddr comand didn't work out of the box. A workaround was found in above refrences. The above noted bdaddr commands works fine(These commands were worked out after much hit and trial using above references))
