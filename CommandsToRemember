EthernetLink: Ethernet connection between Ubuntu(Laptop) and Windows 10(PC)

Windows 10 PC IPv4 Ethernet Address: 169.254.146.90
Laptop Ubuntu IPv4 Ethernet Address: 169.254.160.54
Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0
Windows 10 PC IPv4 wifi Address: 192.168.1.18 (subnet mask: 255.255.255.0)

On Windows 10 PC:
Settings-->Network & Internet-->Ethernet-->Network and Sharing Center

Click 'Ethernet'-->Properties-->open 'Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)' 

Click 'Use the following IP address and fill out the fields as mentioned above (type ipconfig and look for 'Ethernet adapter Ethernet' --> Autoconfiguration IPv4 Address)

Note:For PC 'Defaultt Gateway is the Laptop's Ethernet adapter address


On Ubuntu 20.04 Laptop:
Settings-->Network-->Wired

Open wired settings-->IPv4

Select 'Manual' and fillout the feilds as mentioned above. Leave the Gateway field empty(type ifconfig and look for 'eno1:' --> inet)


Ubuntu File sharing and access:
To share files via Ethernet Cable Change properties for each folder and select 'Share this folder' under 'Local Network Share' tab

To access files from Windows 10 PC, go to 'Other Locations' in Nautilus --> Connect to server (Down below)

Enter smb://169.254.146.90 (Windows 10 PC Ethernet adapter address) . Enter the username and password if prompted (UserName: AnkitPC Password: wingardium05). The bracketed credentials here are also the login credentials for the Windows 10 PC as Administrator

Open the Shared Folder.If needed, bookmark the folder for future use


Windows File sharing and access:
To share folders follow same procedure. Go to folder properties and share the folder

To access the files from ubuntu 20.04, go to 'Network' in Files Explorer. Type '\\iamankit' (Name of the Ubuntu computer/laptop) in address bar and enter. Enter the username and password fields if prompted (UserName: ankit Password: wingardium).
The command 'sudo smbpasswd -a ankit' was invoked to set password for user 'ankit' to enable password protected sharing by Samba. Samba is the default file sharing client for Ubuntu.

When sharing a folder do not check 'Guest share'. Doing so will grant access to the files without prompting for password

Go inside 'IAMANKIT' (Ubuntu 20.04 Laptop's Name represented as a folder). All the shared folders from ubuntu will be inside this Folder (Sometimes 'IAMANKIT' folder might not show up but all the shared folders will still be accessible by following above steps of typing in address bar)


NOTE: All the above steps were done to enable file sharing over Ethernet LAN connection. But file sharing is also working over Wifi connection in both the computers. While simply typing '\\iamankit' in the address bar of file explorer in Windows 10 PC inside 'Network' brings up the shared folders from Ubuntu computer, its not entirely clear if the shared folders are accessible over LAN or Wifi when both connections are active in Windows 10 PC. You can turn off either of the connections (LAN or Wifi) to ensure the shared folders are available only through one connection (LAN or Wifi).
However, The shared folders from Windows 10 PC are accessed in Ubuntu computer by specifically typing a LAN or a Wifi address in Nautilus (Other location-->Connect to server)

NOTE:
Name of Windows 10 PC: TASKMASTER
AdminUser on Windows 10 PC: AnkitPC
AdminPass of AnkitPC on Windows 10 PC: wingardium05

Name of Ubuntu laptop: iamankit
AdminUser of Ubuntu laptop: ankit
AdminPass of ankit on Ubuntu laptop: Ektankit
smb pass for user 'ankit' on Ubuntu laptop: wingardium (file sharing password is different from the login/sudo password)

The password prompt for shared folder access will appear only once for each login session of the PC (i.e Till the PC is restarted). The password was set in ubuntu laptop for user 'ankit'. Same can be done in Windows 10 PC by creating a new user and password and selecting 'Turn on password protected sharing' in 'change advanced sharing options' (Settings-->Network & Internet-->Ethernet) under 'All Networks'

Linux Mint 20.2 uma: (Linux mint 20 is based on ubuntu 20.04 so all packages for ubuntu 20 will work in Linux Mint 20)

gedit --> xed
nautilus --> nemo

Example for installation folder change:
sudo -v && wget -nv -O- https://download.calibre-ebook.com/linux-installer.sh | sudo sh /dev/stdin install_dir=/opt
Where 'install_dir=/opt' is the parameter to change the destination folder for installation (All additional packages/softwares which hasn't been shipped with 'Linux Mint 20.2 Uma' must ideally be installed in '/opt' folder)

snap blocking file default location in Linux Mint: '/etc/apt/preferences.d/nosnap.pref'
Moved the file from its default location to '/home/ankit' folder so that snap packages can be installed in Linux Mint(Linux Mint has disabled snap by default)
'sudo apt install snapd' This command is used for installing snapd daemon to install snap packages in Linux Mint
'snap-store' has been downloaded seperately in Linux mint for downloading snap packages through a gui based interface (snap-store and snapd is not available be default in Linux Mint 20.2 Uma)

The default hotkeys for moving windows to another monitor are Shift+Super(Start)+Arrow

wmctrl -r SMPlayer -b toggle,maximized_vert,maximized_horz
wmctrl -r SMPlayer -b remove,maximized_vert,maximized_horz
where 'toggle' maximizes the window and 'remove' restores the window size 
NOTE: Above commands used in SM_VS_Jugalbandi.sh file placed in the home folder in Linux Mint 20.02. Window positioning isn't working with wmctrl while the windows are in fullscreen mode; the reason why 'toggle' and 'remove' commands are used first before repositioning the window in 'SMPlayer_VSCode_Reposition.sh' and 'SMPlayer_Display_Monitor.sh' files inside home folder in linux mint 20.02

Applets downloaded by me in Linux Mint:
DDC/CI Multi-Monitor by tim-we (Adjust monitor brightness via DDC/CI)
Weather by Gr3q (View your weather forecast)

SMPLayer uses mpv internally (Loading an m3u playlist was behaving weirdly. Also Vlc Uninstalled)
Flatpak and snap versions of VLC do not use system's GTK or QT5 themes because they are containerised apps that do not take any theme variable outside their container

RegEx: ".*" selects a text by its prefix pattern like "<location>.*" would select all the text after and including "<locaion>" in one single line. To replace text by eneumeration in RegEx use "%n" 
TO select all the text found by RegEx use ctrl+shift+L in VSCode. It will select all occurences of that expression

In a script file if u want to execute a command after the previous one succeeds, use '&&' because '&&' is used to run a command after the previous succeeds (Reference: https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Linux/Commands-to-play-songs-and-playlists-from-terminal/td-p/802287)


VSCode:
terminal.integrated.tabs.enabled (For side view or dropdown view of integrated terminal tabs)

VSCode intergrated terminal prompt shorten command:
PS1='\[\033[01;32m\]\u\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\W\[\033[00m\]\$ '
Where '\[\033[01;32m\]' = code prefix for specifying color change options in which '[01;32m\]'= color code information; 01:bold text; 32m:green color, '\u' = user and '\W' = working directory ([00m\] is for keeping a plain text)  

For making custom keyboard shortcuts, go to System Settings --> Keyboard --> Shortcuts --> Custom Shortcuts 


VSCode debugger and devtools for MSEdge:
Installed MSEdge beta on linux (stable realease as per MSEdge website) to work with devtools (exclusively inspect elements) in vscode. There's a default debugger to work with chrome and edge in vscode.
just make a launch.json file with appropriate parameters. Mainly 2 modes: launch or attach for debugger to work with a browser (Edge or Chrome).
'Devtools for Edge' was installed seperately for inspect elements to work in vscode (Bult-in debugger alone does not have the feature to inspect elements)
launch Edge with keyboard custom shorcut as configured (with '--remote-debugging-port=9222' option which is already configured)
open 'run debugger' in vscode and select an appropriate config from drop down beside the run/play button
Note: refer to launch.json file for parameters (Different parameters for different modes i.e lauch or attach). Work with 'Debug Console' and 'Edge dev tools' inside vscode as if working with default browser dev tools
Configured Command:
microsoft-edge --remote-debugging-port=9222 


Alarm clock app:

Pipewire utility:
pipewire installed in linux mint to enable working with HFP profiles with bluetooth devices 
Note: 
1. A2DP profile is needed for stereo sound quality but mic can't be used using this profile
2. HFP profile is needed for mono sound quality and mic can be used using this profile
(Without pipewire installed on the system, HFP profiles weren't working and hence mic couldn't be used with bluetooth devices. As pulseaudio does not support HSP/HFP by default, we can override it with the pipewire library)
